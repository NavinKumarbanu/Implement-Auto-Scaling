# Implementing Auto Scaling

Use Terraform to set up auto scaling for VM instances based on CPU utilization.
Auto Scaling in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) allows you to dynamically adjust the number of virtual machine instances within an instance group based on incoming traffic or workloads. Here are the key points about implementing auto scaling on GCP:

1.Managed Instance Groups (MIGs): Auto scaling is typically configured using Managed Instance Groups. These groups automatically add or remove VM instances based on changes in load. When thereâ€™s more load, instances are added (scaling out), and when demand decreases, instances are removed (scaling in).
2.Policies and Health Checks: You define the autoscaling policy and configure options such as health checks. The autoscaler monitors the load and adjusts the group size accordingly1.
3.Load Balancing: Google Cloud offers server-side load balancing, distributing incoming traffic across multiple VM instances. Load balancing provides benefits like scalability, support for heavy traffic, and automatic removal of unhealthy instances1.
4.Serving Capacity Autoscaling: You can set up autoscaling based on load balancing serving capacity. The autoscaler monitors the serving capacity of an instance group and scales when VM instances are over or under capacity. The serving capacity can be defined based on utilization or requests per second1.
5.Custom Images and Templates: To enable auto scaling, prepare a custom image, define suitable scaling policies, and enable it for your instance group. This empowers your application to handle fluctuations in demand efficiently
